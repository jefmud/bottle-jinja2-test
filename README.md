# bottle-jinja2-test
a quick bottle + jinja2 mock up

This is experimental code to see how easily Jinja2 and PeeWee integrate with the Bottle Microframework.

Dependencies

PeeWee - (Charles Liefer) Compact, expressive, simple ORM on top of Sqlite in-memory or file-based.
I have used successfully with both Sqlite file based and PostgresSQL databases.  (http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/)

Jinja2 - (Armin Ronacher) One of the best web page templating languages available. (http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/)

Bottle - (Marcel Hellkamp) An excellent microframework that does about everything you'd want it to do without bulk and complexity
of something like Pyramid, Django, or Turbogears.  (https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/)
